    <h1>Something about dogs</h1>
    <p>The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris)[4] is a domesticated descendant of the wolf, characterized by an upturning tail. The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,[5][6] and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.[7] The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[8][7] by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[6] before the development of agriculture.[</p>

       <p>Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[9] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[10]Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.[11]</p>
